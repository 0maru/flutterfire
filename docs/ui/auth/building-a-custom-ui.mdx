title: Building a Custom UI
---

The UI package provides various widgets to help you implement authentication in your
application. Widgets provide different layers of abstraction, such as fully styled sign-in screens
to underlying controllers enabling you to build your own UI expierience. The terminology used for these
abstractions are:

- **Screen**: A fully function, pre-styled and customizable widget which offers a complete authentication expereince (such as Sign In, Register, Profile Screen).
- **View**: A fully controlled widget which offers authentication functionality (such as Sign In), however if minimally styled allowing you to build your own UI around the view.
- **Widget**: A barebones widget which renders basic elements of a authentication flow, such as text inputs, buttons, etc.
- **Controller**: The lowest level of abtraction which provides no UI, however provides authentication controls (such as signing in, triggering OAuth flows, etc).

Internally the UI package builds upon these abstractions layers. For example a `SignInScreen` implements multiple `View`s, where a `View` implements and provides basic styling of multiple `Widget`s,
with the `Widget`s implementing a `Controller`.
