FlutterFire UI for Firestore enables you to easily integrate your application UI with your Cloud
Firestore database.

## Installation

To get started with Firebase UI for Firestore, you first need to ensure the `cloud_firestore` plugin is
[installed on you project](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/overview#installation).

If you haven't already done so, install the `flutterfire_ui` package by running the following command in your terminal:

TODO: Change to `flutterfire_ui_firestore` when moved

```bash
flutter pub add flutterfire_ui
```

## Usage

The package provides a number of widgets that can be used to build your Firestore UI.

If you haven't already done so, you'll need to initialize Firebase before using FlutterFire UI.
You can learn more about this in the [FlutterFire Overview](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview#initializing-flutterfire)
documentation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Firebase
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Next, import the FlutterFire UI for Firestore package:

```dart
import 'package:flutterfire_ui/firestore.dart';
```

### `FirestoreListView`

A [ListView.builder] that obtains its items from a Firestore query.

As an example, consider the following collection:

```dart
class Movie {
  Movie({required this.title, required this.genre});

  Movie.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json)
    : this(
        title: json['title']! as String,
        genre: json['genre']! as String,
      );

  final String title;
  final String genre;

  Map<String, Object?> toJson() {
    return {
      'title': title,
      'genre': genre,
    };
  }
}

final moviesCollection = FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('movies').withConverter<Movie>(
     fromFirestore: (snapshot, _) => Movie.fromJson(snapshot.data()!),
     toFirestore: (movie, _) => movie.toJson(),
   );
```

Using [FirestoreListView], we can now show the list of movies by writing:

```dart
FirestoreListView<Movie>(
  query: moviesCollection.orderBy('title'),
  itemBuilder: (context, snapshot) {
    Movie movie = snapshot.data();
    return Text(movie.title);
  },
)
```

For advanced UI use-cases, consider switching to [FirestoreQueryBuilder].

### `FirestoreQueryBuilder`

The [FirestoreQueryBuilder] widget enables you to build any UI within your application, whilst having
the power of realtime Firestore data and infinite scrolling. The widget is a lower-level abstraction of
[FirestoreListView], which gives you full control on exactly how your data is displayed.

```dart
FirestoreQueryBuilder<Movie>(
  query: moviesCollection.orderBy('title'),
  builder: (context, snapshot, _) {
    // Query is loading
    if (snapshot.isFetching) {
      return const CircularProgressIndicator();
    }

    // Something went wrong (e.g. permission denied)
    if (snapshot.hasError) {
      return Text('error ${snapshot.error}');
    }

    return GridView.builder(
      itemCount: snapshot.docs.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        // If we reached the end of the currently obtained items, we try to
        // obtain more items
        if (snapshot.hasMore && index + 1 == snapshot.docs.length) {
          // Tell FirestoreQueryBuilder to try to obtain more items.
          // It is safe to call this function from within the build method.
          snapshot.fetchMore();
        }

        final movie = snapshot.docs[index];

        return Container(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
          child: const Text("${movive.title}"),
          color: Colors.teal[100],
        );
      },
    );
  },
)
```

The [FirestoreQueryBuilder] widget enables us to return any UI we want, whilst also providing the
ability to fetch more data as the user scrolls.
